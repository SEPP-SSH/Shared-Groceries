## Hasan Alshaban's Reflections
#### Hasan's reflections on George
George played a key role in the SSH App team by building the app using Android Studio Ladybug. The SSH App is a critical part of the project, and George ensured that it was functional and able to communicate with the SSH Cloud effectively. Additionally, he worked on the app’s documentation, which was an important part of delivering a complete prototype. His contributions in this area were valuable to the overall success of the project.

George also collaborated with the SSH Cloud team by discussing the integration points where the SSH App depended on the SSH Cloud. These discussions helped ensure that the app’s requirements were clearly understood and implemented on the server side. In addition, George assisted with GitHub management, taking on tasks such as assigning issues and reviewing pull requests. His support in this area helped the overall project stay organized and maintain a smooth workflow.

George has a solid ability to work independently, learn new tools, and communicate ideas effectively. These traits contributed to the project's progress, especially in terms of keeping the SSH App development on track. However, I think he could benefit from engaging his teammate more and delegating tasks within his team. This would allow for a more balanced workload and ensure that everyone contributes to the app’s development.

Overall, George was a dependable team member, and I appreciated his contributions. I believe he has the skills and mindset to be a strong teammate in future projects.

#### Hasan's reflections on Parla
Parla was a member of the SSH App team and contributed by writing unit tests for the app. These tests are an important part of ensuring the app’s functionality and maintaining its reliability. While her contributions were not as extensive as others in this particular project, the work she did helped uphold the quality of the app.

It’s evident that Parla has the confidence and ability to do excellent work, and I believe she has the potential to make significant contributions to any project she’s involved in. For this project, the demands of the SSH App were high, and greater involvement from all team members could have made the workload easier to manage and led to even stronger outcomes.

In the future, I think Parla could benefit from taking on a more active role, engaging more with the team, and exploring opportunities to showcase her skills. She has a lot of potential, and with a little more involvement, she could make an even bigger impact. I have no doubt that with her confidence and abilities, she will excel in any task she takes on.

#### Hasan's reflections on Harvey
Working with Harvey on the SSH Cloud team for the Student Smart Homes project has been an enlightening experience. His strong leadership and organizational skills were pivotal in keeping our work structured and efficient. Harvey's ability to manage our GitHub repository, ensuring clear documentation and streamlined workflows, greatly benefited the entire group. Whenever there were questions or uncertainties, he was the go-to person, demonstrating both deep technical expertise and a willingness to assist others.

One of Harvey's standout strengths is his proactive approach. Not only did he take on a significant portion of the workload, but he also ensured that the team had the resources and guidance needed to progress effectively. For instance, his clear approach to organizing the database schema was crucial in ensuring seamless development. His attention to detail in code reviews and his ability to foresee potential issues saved the team considerable time and effort.

One area where Harvey could grow is in delegation. While his dedication to completing tasks is admirable, sharing responsibilities more evenly among team members could foster a more balanced workload and encourage others to contribute more actively. This would also help the team members develop skills in areas such as project organization and troubleshooting.

Looking ahead, I would suggest that Harvey continue leveraging his leadership skills while fostering a more collaborative environment by actively delegating tasks. This would not only enhance team productivity but also build a stronger, more cohesive team dynamic. Overall, Harvey's contributions were invaluable, and I look forward to collaborating with him on future projects.
