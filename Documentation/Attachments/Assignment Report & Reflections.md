## What we accomplished
We selected Harvey’s EDR to prototype, and subsequently implemented – for Student Smart Homes (SSH) – a group grocery shopping feature in the SSH App, a supporting request handling server in SSH Cloud, which itself draws on a MySQL database server.

The prototype allows a user that’s a part of a shared house to contribute to group grocery orders with partner supermarkets. The user can choose which supermarket to place an order with, and can have orders with more than one supermarket at a given time. The user can browse for items to add to an order, change the quantity they’ve added in the basket, and outright remove them. The user cannot remove items added by other housemates, and pays only for the items that they added themselves. This prototype only simulates one user adding items at a given time, making the feature clearer to understand. Submitting a group order, payment splitting and payments processing have been omitted from the prototype, and are instead simulated by order submission always being accepted, with no additional processing. The EDR has also been altered to not implement item search functionality, nor the feature for the SSH Console table, and to omit the order deadline condition.

## Hasan Alshaban's Reflections
#### Hasan's reflections on George
George played a key role in the SSH App team by building the app using Android Studio Ladybug. The SSH App is a critical part of the project, and George ensured that it was functional and able to communicate with the SSH Cloud effectively. Additionally, he worked on the app’s documentation, which was an important part of delivering a complete prototype. His contributions in this area were valuable to the overall success of the project.

George also collaborated with the SSH Cloud team by discussing the integration points where the SSH App depended on the SSH Cloud. These discussions helped ensure that the app’s requirements were clearly understood and implemented on the server side. In addition, George assisted with GitHub management, taking on tasks such as assigning issues and reviewing pull requests. His support in this area helped the overall project stay organized and maintain a smooth workflow.

George has a solid ability to work independently, learn new tools, and communicate ideas effectively. These traits contributed to the project's progress, especially in terms of keeping the SSH App development on track. However, I think he could benefit from engaging his teammate more and delegating tasks within his team. This would allow for a more balanced workload and ensure that everyone contributes to the app’s development.

Overall, George was a dependable team member, and I appreciated his contributions. I believe he has the skills and mindset to be a strong teammate in future projects.

#### Hasan's reflections on Parla
Parla was a member of the SSH App team and contributed by writing unit tests for the app. These tests are an important part of ensuring the app’s functionality and maintaining its reliability. While her contributions were not as extensive as others in this particular project, the work she did helped uphold the quality of the app.

It’s evident that Parla has the confidence and ability to do excellent work, and I believe she has the potential to make significant contributions to any project she’s involved in. For this project, the demands of the SSH App were high, and greater involvement from all team members could have made the workload easier to manage and led to even stronger outcomes.

In the future, I think Parla could benefit from taking on a more active role, engaging more with the team, and exploring opportunities to showcase her skills. She has a lot of potential, and with a little more involvement, she could make an even bigger impact. I have no doubt that with her confidence and abilities, she will excel in any task she takes on.

#### Hasan's reflections on Harvey
Working with Harvey on the SSH Cloud team for the Student Smart Homes project has been an enlightening experience.
