# SSH App Backend
---
## Introduction

The SSH app has been split into frontend and backend development allowing developers to work on each part individually. All the network connectivity for the app is in the `ServerHelper` class and a separate IntelliJ project has been created to develop this separately to the app. The app will then utlise the methods in this class later when the systems are integrated.
